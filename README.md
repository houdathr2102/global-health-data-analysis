Explore health trends across countries (e.g., diabetes, vaccination rates, life expectancy), and uncover insights about regional disparities, temporal changes, or correlations with development indicators.

# Global Health Analysis: Life Expectancy, Diabetes, and Vaccination

This project merges public datasets to examine how life expectancy is influenced by diabetes prevalence and COVID-19 vaccine coverage across countries.

## Data Sources:
- Life Expectancy (WHO): Country, Status, Life Expectancy
- Diabetes Prevalence (Our World in Data)
- COVID-19 Vaccination (Our World in Data)

## Columns:
- `Country`
- `Status`: Developed or Developing
- `Life_expectancy`
- `Diabetes_prevalence`
- `Vaccination_rate`

## Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Insights:
- Diabetes prevalence is negatively correlated with life expectancy.
- Higher vaccination coverage is generally associated with greater life expectancy.
- Developed countries have higher vaccination rates and life expectancy on average.
